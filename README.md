## **Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) Slabbing**

This repository aims to complete our submission at the DeepBreath MICCAI's 
workshop entitled "Thick Slices for Optimal Digital Breast
Tomosynthesis Classification With Deep-Learning".

We will provide the data mapping used in our study, to make it easily reproducible.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first study exploring DBT from the EA1141
public dataset. To this end, we give detailed information about the data strategy.
